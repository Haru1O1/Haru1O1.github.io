## Introduction
Cybercrime is expected at the end of 2023 to cost over $8 trillion worldwide. According to the FBI’s annual Internet Crime Report in 2021, the cost of cybercrime for the US was $6.9 billion in 2022, the cost increased by 49% to $10.3 billion. The table below shows the steadily increasing cost of a data breach in the millions. In response, since 2022, the UN has been gradually negotiating an international treaty for countering cybercrime. The problem is that this treaty intended for global cooperation against stopping cybercrime may be used to stiffen free speech, incentivize nations to share the personal data of their residents and criminalize behaviors or contents that they deem dangerous.

## The Cybercrime Treaty
As cybercrime continues to increase annually, the United Nations has decided to combat it. At the end of February 2022, the negotiations for the treaty to counter cybercrime started. Now, it is 2023, and just two months ago, the negotiations for the first draft of the treaty were held at the UN headquarters in New York. Voting for this treaty will begin at the start of January 2024. The “first draft” of the treaty was finished and edited on September 1, 2023.

## Issues about the treaty
Multiple groups, such as Microsoft or the Electronic Frontier Foundation have criticized aspects of the treaty. Due to its broad definitions of what constitutes cybercrime and how it can easily be misinterpreted to lead to the abuse of human rights. One of the provisions of the treaty is the legal implications of government access to personal data for “real-time surveillance” for anything they deem dangerous or as a crime to the nation. The treaty also does not provide any way for corporations to notify individuals who are targets of surveillance. Furthermore, in Chapter IV, Article 23 the scope of surveillance is further broadened to any crime as long as there is digital evidence available. Ethical hacking, aka hacking that is within the confines of the law, is also not referenced away from criminal intent, which could make penetration testing illegal. The clause about the misuse of security tools is also incredibly vague and can constitute simply breaking TOS. Under the treaty security researchers must also ask companies for “prior authorization” before they can conduct research. Any discoveries of vulnerabilities by misusing devices or interfering with computer systems will now fall under criminal activity if done without prior consent from the corporation under which the system or device falls under. In Article 28, it has a provision that could be interpreted allowing governments to put out mandates to help break into computer systems. In Article 13, the treaty also deems any written material that may harm children as criminal. This can easily be interpreted by blocking any content the country deems dangerous. Take a country like China, which has implemented a time limit for how long children, an individual less than 18, can play games, which in 2021 was changed to an hour from 90 minutes. Now imagine that to be worldwide, and instead of being time-limited, the content is outright banned or deleted. There are no safeguards to prevent countries or even states from criminalizing any content they believe to be harmful to children. These are only a few provisions in the treaty that need to be amended before the vote at the start of January 2024.

## Why does it matter
The vagueness of treaty has disastrous consequences. Take a different international organization INTERPOL, an international criminal police organization, started in 1923 to promote global cooperation between law enforcement. Although it started as an organization to help capture criminals, it has slowly been used by nations and organizations to cripple freedom of speech. Nations such as Russia or China have been documented to use Interpol’s Red Notice, which are requests for police forces worldwide to arrest a suspect to attack critics and anyone who they deem to be dangerous to the nation. How likely is the treaty, if passed without significant changes to allow for global surveillance on anyone? If the treaty does not account for its possible misuse nations will now be allowed to legally survey anyone they so choose and with INTERPOL be able to arrest and detain any individual they find to be dangerous to their beliefs. How many of them will be individuals who speak out against the government rather than criminals?
May we never need to find out.
