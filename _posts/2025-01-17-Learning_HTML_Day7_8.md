        // to
        canVote = age >= 18 ? "Yes" : "No";
        ```
- ESLint
    - Extension for VS Code

- Arrays(JavaScript)
    - Type of data structure
        - can hold more than one value
    - Index starts at zero
    - To use an array use the brackets symbol
        - Example -> `const fruits = ["üçâ", "üçì", "üçé"]`
    - Map
        - Goes through each element and makes a new array by implementing a function with it
        - For example

                return fruit !== "üçé";
            });
            ```
- React Hooks
    - Functions that use state and lifecycle features in functional components
    - Use state hooks when updated changes the entire appearance of the page
    - Example
    -   ```javascript
        import { useState } from "react";

        function Counter() {
            const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

            return (
                <div>
                    <p>Count: {count}</p>
                    <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>

        ```

## Day 8 - Videos 95-109
- React Server vs React Client Components
    - Components are labeled as a **server** or **client** depending on how its rendered
    - An internet browser has no idea that React's JS or any other library is in use
        - It does not understand the code
        - So React needs to take the code and transform it into something the browser can understand
            - This is known as the rendering process
                - If the rendering is done on the server it is a **Server Component**
                - If the rendering is done on the browser it is a **Client Component**
    - **Server Component**
        - By default, all React components are labeled as **Server Component**
        - `How It Works`
            - When a client visits a website the server checks the React JS code and turns it into a HTML page
            - That page is then sent back to the browser who then shows it to the client
        - `Major Advantages`
            - The code is mostly private and unknown to the users/clients
            - Data that is transmitted across the internet is minimal -> only what the client/user needs to see
            - Reduces the size of the HTML page which makes it run faster
        - `Caveat`
            - React.js features or client components are needed to listen to  events for some elements
    - **Client Component**
        - The server does not compile all the code but rather it sends back an empty skeleton with some guidelines for how to transform it into a valid HTML
        - The client will receive a big JavaScript page and then React will compile the code inside the browser
        - All the client components are transformed into clients.html
        - Unlike server components, these features are visible to the clients 
        - `Major Advantages`
            - User interactivity -> listen for click events or React hooks
            - Allows access to browser features such as storage or alerts
        - To label the component as a client
            - Type on the top of the js file `"use client";`
    - 
- Creating a FAQ Section
    - List of questions and answers
    - When a user clicks on a question the answer should be displayed
    - PsuedoCode
        - First, a use state react hook is required to keep track of whether the question was clicked and when it is unclicked (true to false)
        - Next, a conditional rendering is needed as if it is open then show the answer else show nothing
        - For each question and answer it should return the client component
- Anchor Links
    - Allow for the ability to move to different sections on the page
    - Example 
    -   ```javascript
        <a href="#section1">Go to Section 1</a>
        <a href="#section2">Go to Section 2</a>

        <section id="section1">
            <h2>Section 1</h2>
            p>This is Section 1 content.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="section2">
            <h2>Section 2</h2>
            <p>This is Section 2 content.</p>
        </section>
        ```
- Next.js Image Component
    - In traditional HTML to add an image a source URL is required and an alt can be added for a short description
        - One drawback is that the image resolution and file size are not optimized
    - Example
    -   ```javascript
        import imgDemo from "./img1_ex.jpg";
        import Image from "next/image";
        ...
        <Image src={imgDemo} alt="A Image" />
        ```
- Vercel
    - https://vercel.com/
    - provides a server for use that can take the code and be used publicly
    - Steps (Website Version)
        1. Login or Create an account on Vercel
        2. Import your repository (GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket).
        3. Configure the Project
        4. Deploy the Project
            - The preview URL should be -> https://your-project-name.vercel.app
        5. Continuous Deployment
            - Every time you push or update the repository linked to the Vercel it automatically rebuilds and redeploy the project
        6. Custom Domain (Optional)
            - Custom domain (e.g., mywebsite.com) -> Domains section & Add
        7. Monitor and Manage Deployments
            - Vercel has performance analytics
            - It can also monitor deployment status, view logs, or roll back previous versions
- Commands 
    -   ```
        npm run dev   # For development mode  
        npm run build # Build the project  
        npm start     # Start the production build
        ```
- Subdomains
    - After obtaining a domain any prefix(subdomain) before the actual domain is considered a subdomain
    - Example:  
    Main Domain : mywebsite.com 
    Subdomain : blog.mywebsite.com
    - Particularly used to separate different sections or services of a website
- DNS Records
    - A record 
        - Also known as Address Record 
        - points a domain to a IP address
        - The primary record for routing traffic to a website or server
        - Example:  
        Name  : @ or mywebsite.com  
        Value : 1.1.1.1
    - CNAME Record 
        - Also known as Canonical Name Record
        - Maps a subdomain to another domain name rather than an IP address
        - Used to point one domain or subdomain to another domain
        - Example:  
        Name  : www
        Value : mywebsite.com
    - MX Record
        - Also known as Mail Exchange Record
        - Directs email traffic to the mail servers
        - Example:  
        Name     :  @(root domain)
        Value    :  mail.mywebsite.com (mail server address)
        Priority :  10 (lower the higher the priority)
    - TXT Record
        - Also known as Text Record
        - Stores textual information for email validation, domain ownership verification, and security
        - Used for
            - SPF (Sender Policy Framework) prevents email spoofing
            - DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail) validates email messages
            - Domain Verification -> Google Search Console or SSL certificates.
        - Example:  
        Name  : @(root domain)  
        Value : v=DKIM1; p=MIGfMA0GCSqGSIb...
- Database
    - Allows for quick and easy storage of data and the ability to move, edit, and delete said data
    - For example for users, the information that needs to be stored in their login information
        - Such as email, username, password, etc
    - Or if it is a website for social interactions the comments and posts need to be also stored
    - Connection stream, API key, lets anyone with the key do anything on the database
    - The connection should be done serverside the client should not be able to connect to the database directly
    - SQL (structured query language)
        - structured
        - MYSQL
            - one of the most popular SQL database
